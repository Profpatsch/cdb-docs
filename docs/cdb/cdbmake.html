<h1>The cdbmake and cdbdump programs</h1>
<pre>
     cdbmake <i>f</i> <i>ftmp</i>
</pre>
<tt>cdbmake</tt> reads a series of encoded records
from its standard input
and writes a
<a href="cdb.txt">constant database</a>
to <tt><i>f</i></tt>.
<p>
<tt>cdbmake</tt> ensures that <tt><i>f</i></tt>
is updated atomically,
so programs reading <tt><i>f</i></tt>
never have to wait for <tt>cdbmake</tt> to finish.
It does this by first writing the database to <tt><i>ftmp</i></tt>
and then moving <tt><i>ftmp</i></tt> on top of <tt><i>f</i></tt>.
If <tt><i>ftmp</i></tt> already exists, it is destroyed.
The directories containing <tt><i>ftmp</i></tt> and <tt><i>f</i></tt>
must be writable to <tt>cdbmake</tt>;
they must also be on the same filesystem.
<p>
<tt>cdbmake</tt> always makes sure that <tt><i>ftmp</i></tt>
is safely written to disk before it replaces <tt><i>f</i></tt>.
If the input is in a bad format
or if <tt>cdbmake</tt> has any trouble
writing <tt><i>ftmp</i></tt> to disk,
<tt>cdbmake</tt> complains and leaves <tt><i>f</i></tt> alone.
<p>
<pre>
     cdbdump
</pre>
<tt>cdbdump</tt>
reads a constant database from its standard input
and prints the database contents,
in <tt>cdbmake</tt> format,
on standard output.
<h2>Record format</h2>
Records are indexed by <b>keys</b>.
A key is a string.
<tt><i>f</i></tt>
is structured so that another program,
starting from a key, can quickly find the relevant record.
<tt>cdbmake</tt> allows several records with the same key,
although
<ul>
<li>most readers take only the first record, and
<li><tt>cdbmake</tt> slows down somewhat
if there are many records with the same key.
</ul>
<tt>cdbmake</tt> and <tt>cdbdump</tt> preserve the order of records.
<p>
A record is encoded for <tt>cdbmake</tt>
as <tt>+<i>klen</i>,<i>dlen</i>:<i>key</i>-&gt;<i>data</i></tt>
followed by a newline.
Here <tt><i>klen</i></tt> is the number of bytes in <tt><i>key</i></tt>
and <tt><i>dlen</i></tt> is the number of bytes in <tt><i>data</i></tt>.
The end of data is indicated by an extra newline.
For example:
<pre>
     +3,5:one-&gt;Hello
     +3,7:two-&gt;Goodbye

</pre>
<tt><i>key</i></tt> and <tt><i>data</i></tt>
may contain any characters,
including colons, dashes, newlines, and nulls.
<p>
Keys and data do not have to fit into memory,
but <tt>cdbmake</tt> needs roughly 16 bytes of memory per record.
A database cannot exceed 4 gigabytes.
<p>
<tt><i>f</i></tt> is portable across machines.
