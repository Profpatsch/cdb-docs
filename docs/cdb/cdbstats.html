<h1>The cdbstats and cdbtest programs</h1>
<tt>cdbstats</tt>
reads a (seekable) constant database
from its standard input
and prints a few statistics:
<ul>
<li><tt>records</tt> is the number of records in the database,
<li><tt>d0</tt> is the number of records at distance 0 from their hash,
<li><tt>d1</tt> is the number of records at distance 1 from their hash, etc.
</ul>
<p>
<tt>cdbtest</tt>
reads a (seekable) constant database
from its standard input.
For each record in the database,
it double-checks that the record can be found by its key.
It prints tallies in several categories:
<ul>
<li><tt>found</tt> is the number of records
found correctly by their keys.
<li><tt>different record</tt> is the number of records
where a different record was found with the same key.
This should not happen unless the database has multiple records
with the same key.
<li><tt>bad length</tt> is the number of records
found but with the wrong data length.
This should never happen.
<li><tt>not found</tt> is the number of records not found.
This should never happen.
<li><tt>untested</tt> is the number of records
with keys longer than 1024 bytes.
<tt>cdbtest</tt> doesn't bother testing these records.
</ul>
